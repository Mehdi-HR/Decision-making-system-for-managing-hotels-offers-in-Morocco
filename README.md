# Decision-making-system-for-managing-hotels-offers-in-Morocco

In Morocco, tourism was among the sectors most affected by the health crisis and by the travel restrictions that have been adopted to limit the spread of the virus.
In fact, arrivals at border crossings have dropped drastically and overnight stays in accommodation establishments have followed the same trend, with a regression of -72%.

Hence the idea of creating a decision-making system for managing hotels' offers, in order to get insights about the offers proposed by the establishments of tourist accommodation.
